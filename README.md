# locations
A project to collect information concerning yacht cruising locations

Files in the [docs directory](.docs) will be published to the [Locations website](https://smr547.github.io/locations/)

A KML file containing all the defined locations will be published soon. We plan to use thomas.dreamhost to host the build service
and KML server.
