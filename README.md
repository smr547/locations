# locations
A project to collect information concerning yacht cruising locations

Files in the [docs directory](.docs) will be published to the [Locations website](https://smr547.github.io/locations/)

A KML file containing all the defined locations will be published soon. This file can be view with the Google Earth
applicatin. We plan to use a dreamhost server to host the build service and KML server.
