# Locations Project
This is a project to allow cruising sailors to collect and disseminate information about cruising locations
throughout the world. To make a contribution simply [Signup to GitHub](https://github.com/join) and then create or edit files 
in the [docs directory](https://github.com/smr547/locations/tree/master/docs)

A ``How To`` document will be published soon. But for now, simply follow the examples in the 
[docs directory](https://github.com/smr547/locations/tree/master/docs)

# Location files
Here is what we have built so far:
